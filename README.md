# Carbon Incentive Program Analysis in Beijing

## Project Overview

This project analyzes the effectiveness of a carbon incentive program implemented in Beijing, with a focus on its relationship with individual and spatial characteristics. The study confirms the long-term impact of behavioral interventions on individual travel behaviors and the associated potential for carbon emission reduction, particularly through the promotion of Mobility-as-a-Service (MaaS). We also highlight the heterogeneous responses of individuals to incentives and the resulting variations in carbon reductions. Furthermore, we identify the characteristics of areas where the implementation of these incentives is most effective, providing insights for the global scaling and replication of carbon incentive programs.
